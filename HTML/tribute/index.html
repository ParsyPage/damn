            Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was a profound Indian Hindu monk and philosopher who introduced Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, famously at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago with his "Sisters and brothers of America" speech, advocating universal acceptance and service to humanity. A key disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he founded the Ramakrishna Mission, focused on spiritual upliftment through self-realization and selfless work (Karma Yoga), and inspired Indian nationalism by emphasizing the divinity within all people. He remains a revered patriotic saint, with his January 12th birthday celebrated as National Youth Day in India.
